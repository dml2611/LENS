"I’m a 32-year-old female, living in Canada. I was first diagnosed with stage 2 melanoma four years ago. It started as a pinkish lesion on my thigh that wouldn’t heal, so I decided to get it checked. They did a wide excision, and luckily it hadn’t spread to my lymph nodes at that time. For a couple of years, I thought I was in the clear, but last year I found a hard lump under my arm that turned out to be a metastatic tumor. They confirmed it had progressed to stage 3 and recommended immediate surgery and follow-up treatment.

After the surgery, I started on pembrolizumab for adjuvant therapy. The side effects have been overwhelming — severe muscle pain, constant fever, and bouts of diarrhea that keep me from leaving the house. My hair has started thinning, and I’ve developed vitiligo patches on my hands and face. The doctors say that’s a sign the treatment is working, but it’s hard to stay positive when I don’t even recognize myself in the mirror anymore. I’ve also been dealing with insomnia and panic attacks, especially before each scan appointment, fearing that the cancer might have spread further.

In addition to the physical symptoms, I’m struggling emotionally. I’m normally a very active person who loves hiking and swimming, but now I’m just exhausted all the time. The fatigue is so intense that sometimes I feel like I’m dragging my body around. I’m also coping with the fact that I might never be able to have children because of the damage these treatments can do to fertility. It’s a heartbreaking reality that no one seems to talk about enough.

Despite everything, I’m still pushing through and trying my best to stay positive. I’ve started practicing mindfulness and yoga, which helps to some extent. I’ve also joined a few online support groups specifically for young women with melanoma, and hearing their stories gives me hope. If anyone has been through this kind of treatment, especially with pembrolizumab, I would love to hear how you managed the side effects and any tips for maintaining energy and mental health."
