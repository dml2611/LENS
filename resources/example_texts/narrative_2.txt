"I’m a 45-year-old male living in Australia. I was diagnosed with stage 4 melanoma about two years ago. It started as a small mole on my back that didn’t seem suspicious at first, but gradually turned darker and started bleeding. By the time I went to see a dermatologist, it had already spread to my lymph nodes and other parts of my body, including my liver and bones. I’ve undergone multiple treatments since then, starting with surgery to remove the primary tumor and affected lymph nodes.

Currently, I’m on a combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab for immunotherapy. The side effects are brutal — constant nausea, joint pain, and severe fatigue. The worst part is the skin rashes that flare up all over my body, making it almost unbearable to move at times. I’ve also been dealing with neuropathy in my hands and feet, which makes simple tasks like writing or holding a cup difficult. Despite the pain, the immunotherapy has managed to stabilize my condition for now.

However, I’m haunted by the thought that these drugs can stop working at any moment. My oncologist has been straightforward that once the cancer becomes resistant, there aren’t many options left. I’m doing everything I can — taking additional supplements like turmeric and vitamin D, eating a strict anti-inflammatory diet, and seeing a therapist to cope with the anxiety and depression that come with this diagnosis.

It’s not just the physical pain that’s difficult; it’s the mental toll of dealing with the uncertainty and the fear of what’s next. I sometimes feel so isolated, especially because I don’t want to burden my family with my constant worries. I’ve joined support groups, both online and in-person, which has helped me connect with others going through similar struggles. I try to focus on staying positive, but there are days when I feel utterly defeated. Is there anyone else who has had success with nivolumab and ipilimumab for this long? Any advice on managing the side effects?"
